- 👋 Hi, I'm Francesco
- 👀 I'm interested in web dev(mainly back end but happy to mess around with CSS, HTML and JS ), android applications and basically everything gives me a chance to write code lines.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning more about frameworks (React and Angular), Three library and thousands of other cool stuff. 
- 💞️ I'd love to collaborate on game development, but I'm up for everything. Throw me a challenge and I'll be happy to catch it.
